# Unit 19 React Homework: Employee Directory

## Overview

I created a employee directory with React. The Aplication's UI is broken down into components, able to manage component state, and can respond to user events.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.


The application will able the user to sort and filter through the table.
